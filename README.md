# QuizAppProject
This is my Quiz app project about science.
During the period of studying this course, i have learnt a lot that has improved my skills and interest to become an
Android developer.
During the first stage about the program, i learnt user interface (XML) which include Linear, Relative and nested Layout.
Based on theses skills it opened the way for me to use constrain layout in my project.
The concepts i used in my project include:
Creaating new android project.
Undernstading basics of material design.
Creating variables and instantiating them.
Constructing method and using it either public or private.
Public method can be accessed from different activity but private mrthod cannot.
Before you can use any object example TextView, Button or ImageView you need to create an object of that class.
Based on these tutorials it opened a way for me to add other functionality to my project, for example am able to create button
OnClickLister to move to different activity and am able to use constrain layout.
